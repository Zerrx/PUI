Remove file copying of Word documents
	Instead of copying files which have been secured, secure file internal data and paths
	Modify data according to current dates, times, or other needs
	Utilize 7-zip (if installed) or Windows' zip-archiver program to compress the data and store the resulting compressed file in a "TEMP" directory
	Copy and rename the new compressed file to the designated name as a ".DOCX" file
